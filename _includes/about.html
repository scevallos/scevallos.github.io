                    <p class="subheading"> Hi there! I'm Sebastian, a Computer Science Major at Pomona College.</p>
                    <p class="subheading">
                    I was studying chemistry at Pomona, until I realized how much I love computer science! I decided to switch my major and will graduate with a B.A. in Computer Science, minoring in Chemistry and Math in May 2018.</p>

                    <p class="subheading"> As a <a href="http://www.code2040.org/">Code2040</a> Fellow, I am passionate about bridging the gap in the tech industry for underepresented groups and hope to be a part of changing the demographic within. </p>

                    <p>In my spare time, I enjoy working on personal projects, volleyball, ping pong, and being at the beach. My resume is linked above. You can also find my contact information below.</p>
